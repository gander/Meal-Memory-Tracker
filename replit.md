- **meals**: Core meal records with ratings and metadata
- **meal_people**: Many-to-many relationship for meal participants

#### Rating System
- Four-dimensional rating scale (-3 to +3) for:

- Dynamic image serving via `/api/images/{id}` endpoint
- Robust image deletion with resilience to missing files
- Automatic cleanup when meals are deleted or photos replaced

## Data Flow

1. **Meal Creation**: User uploads photo → AI analysis → Form pre-population → Manual adjustments → Database storage
2. **Meal Viewing**: Database query → Rating calculations → Statistics aggregation → UI rendering
3. **Search/Filter**: Client-side query parameters → Server-side filtering → Paginated results
4. **Statistics**: Real-time aggregation of meal data for dashboard metrics

### Build Process
1. Frontend assets compiled with Vite to `dist/public`
2. Backend compiled with esbuild to `dist/index.js`
3. Single server serves both API and static assets
4. Database migrations applied via `drizzle-kit push`

### Environment Configuration
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: AI service authentication
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)
