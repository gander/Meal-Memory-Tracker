## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Style**: RESTful API with file upload support
- **File Handling**: Multer for image upload processing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store

### Key Components

#### Database Schema
- **restaurants**: Restaurant information (name, address)
- **dishes**: Dish catalog with categories
- **people**: People who participate in meals
- **meals**: Core meal records with ratings and metadata
- **meal_people**: Many-to-many relationship for meal participants

#### Rating System
- Four-dimensional rating scale (-3 to +3) for:
  - Taste quality
  - Visual presentation
  - Value for money
  - Service quality
- Binary flags for "excellent" meals and "want again" preferences

#### AI Integration
- OpenAI GPT-4o integration for photo analysis
- Automatic dish name and category suggestions
- Intelligent rating predictions based on visual analysis
- Polish language support for suggestions

#### File Management
- Local file storage in `/uploads` directory
- Image validation and size limits (5MB max)
- Static file serving for uploaded photos
- Robust image deletion with resilience to missing files
- Automatic cleanup when meals are deleted or photos replaced

## Data Flow

1. **Meal Creation**: User uploads photo → AI analysis → Form pre-population → Manual adjustments → Database storage
2. **Meal Viewing**: Database query → Rating calculations → Statistics aggregation → UI rendering
3. **Search/Filter**: Client-side query parameters → Server-side filtering → Paginated results
4. **Statistics**: Real-time aggregation of meal data for dashboard metrics

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Serverless PostgreSQL connection
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe SQL query builder
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/***: Headless UI components
- **openai**: AI service integration
- **multer**: File upload handling

### Development Tools
- **drizzle-kit**: Database migrations and schema management
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development
- **esbuild**: Production build bundling

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Backend**: tsx with live reload
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem

### Production
- **Frontend**: Static build served by Express
- **Backend**: Compiled ESM bundle
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL (same as dev)
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem (uploads directory)

### Build Process
1. Frontend assets compiled with Vite to `dist/public`
2. Backend compiled with esbuild to `dist/index.js`
3. Single server serves both API and static assets
4. Database migrations applied via `drizzle-kit push`

### Environment Configuration
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: AI service authentication
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Database Choice
- **Problem**: Need reliable, scalable database with minimal setup
- **Solution**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Rationale**: Serverless scaling, strong typing, minimal configuration

### AI Integration Strategy
- **Problem**: Manual dish categorization is time-consuming
- **Solution**: OpenAI GPT-4o for automatic photo analysis
- **Rationale**: Latest vision model with multilingual support

### File Storage Approach
- **Problem**: Need simple image storage for meal photos
- **Solution**: Local filesystem with Express static serving
- **Rationale**: Simple deployment, no external dependencies

### State Management Pattern
- **Problem**: Complex server state synchronization
- **Solution**: TanStack Query for caching and synchronization
- **Rationale**: Automatic background updates, optimistic updates, error handling
